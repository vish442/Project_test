%% Displays the estimated time to finish a for loop
%
% Inputs:
%   tot_toc - initial time spent so far
%   curr_ix - current for loop index value
%   tot_iter - for loop end index value
% Outputs:
%   tot_toc - output the input value so we can use it (see usage below)
%   estimated_time_hours - estimated time in hours (in case you need it)
%
% IMPORTANT: USAGE
% 
% % declare tot_toc as 0
% tot_toc = 0;
% for i=init_iter:tot_iter
%   % before anything, get tic
%   tic
%   % perform your computations
%   ...
%   % at the end, call this function like this:
%   tot_toc = DisplayEstimatedTimeOfLoop( tot_toc+toc, i, tot_iter-init_iter );
% end
%
% This way you are able to keep giving the function the current time spent
%
% Keep in mind Hofstadter's Law when using this function :)
